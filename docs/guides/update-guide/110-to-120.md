The following sections explain which adjustments must be made to migrate from Camunda Cloud 1.1.x to 1.2.0 for each component of the system.

:::caution

 We identified an issue in our recent release of Operate and Tasklist 1.2.0
 (part of Camunda Cloud 1.2.0) in Camunda Cloud SaaS. Only owners of an
 organization have full access to Operate and Tasklist, other members of the
 organization have read-only access to the applications. This issue will be
 resolved with Operate and Tasklist release 1.2.1.

## Server

### Operate

With Operate 1.2, a new feature was introduced to quickly navigate a call
activity hierarchy. This feature is only available for instances started after
the version 1.2 update. Older instances will not expose this information to the
user.
